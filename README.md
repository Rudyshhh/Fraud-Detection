## Project Description
A comprehensive fraud detection system that leverages machine learning to identify potentially fraudulent financial transactions with high accuracy and minimal false positives.

### Key Features
- Multiple machine learning model implementations
- Advanced feature engineering
- Robust preprocessing techniques
- Detailed performance evaluation
- Visualization of key insights

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Pip package manager

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fraud-detection-project.git
cd fraud-detection-project
```

### Dependencies
Install required libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Required libraries include:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- xgboost

## Data Preprocessing

### Cleaning Steps
- Handle missing values
- Remove personal identifiers
- Normalize numerical features
- Encode categorical variables
- Create derived features

### Feature Engineering
- Time-based features extraction
- Transaction amount categorization
- Balance change calculations
- Categorical encoding

## Model Architecture
The project implements an ensemble approach with three classifiers:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest Classifier
3. XGBoost Classifier

### Model Evaluation Metrics
- Classification Report
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC AUC Score
- Average Precision Score

## Usage

### Running the Script
```bash
python fraud_detection.py
```

### Input Data
Prepare your fraud dataset as a CSV file with the following recommended columns:
- step
- amount
- type
- oldbalanceOrg
- newbalanceOrig
- oldbalanceDest
- newbalanceDest
- isFraud

## Performance Metrics

### Model Comparison
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

### Evaluation Visualizations
